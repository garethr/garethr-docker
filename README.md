Puppet module for installing
[Docker](https://github.com/dotcloud/docker) from the [official repository](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/ubuntulinux/) on Ubuntu or from [EPEL on RedHat](http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/rhel/) based distributions.

This module is also available on the [Puppet
Forge](https://forge.puppetlabs.com/garethr/docker)

## Usage

The module includes a single class:

```puppet
include 'docker'
```

By default this sets up the docker hosted Apt repository and installs
the lxc-docker package and the required Kernel.

If you don't want this module to mess about with your Kernel then you
can disable this feature like so:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  manage_kernel => false,
}
```

If you want to configure your package sources independently,
inform this module to not auto-include upstream sources:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  use_upstream_package_source => false,
}
```

By default the docker daemon will bind to a unix socket at
/var/run/docker.sock. This can be changed, as well as binding to a tcp
socket if required.

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  tcp_bind    => 'tcp://127.0.0.1:4243',
  socket_bind => 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock',
}
```

Unless specified this installs the latest version of docker from the
lxc-docker package. However if you want to specify a specific version
you can do so:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  version => '0.5.5',
}
```

In some cases dns resolution won't work well in the container unless you give a dns server to the docker daemon like this:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  dns => '8.8.8.8',
}
```

### Images

The next step is probably to install a docker image, for this we have a defined type which can be used like so:

```puppet
docker::image { 'base': }
```

This is equivalent to running `docker pull base`. This is downloading a large binary so on first run can take a while. For that reason this define turns off the default 5 minute timeout for exec. Takes an optional parameter for installing image tags that is the equivalent to running `docker pull -t="precise" ubuntu`:  

```puppet
docker::image { 'ubuntu':
  image_tag => 'precise'
}
```

Note: images will only install if an image of that name does not already exist.  

You can also remove images you no longer need with:  

```puppet
docker::image { 'base':
  ensure => 'absent'
}

docker::image { 'ubuntu':
  ensure    => 'absent',
  image_tag => 'precise'
}
```

### Containers

Now you have an image you can run commands within a container managed by docker.

```puppet
docker::run { 'helloworld':
  image   => 'base',
  command => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
}
```

This is equivalent to running the following under upstart:

    docker run -d base /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"

Run also contains a number of optional parameters:

```puppet
docker::run { 'helloworld':
  image           => 'base',
  command         => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
  ports           => ['4444', '4555'],
  links           => ['mysql:db'],
  use_name        => true,
  volumes         => ['/var/lib/couchdb', '/var/log'],
  volumes_from    => '6446ea52fbc9',
  memory_limit    => 10485760, # bytes 
  username        => 'example',
  hostname        => 'example.com',
  env             => ['FOO=BAR', 'FOO2=BAR2'],
  dns             => ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'],
  restart_service => true,
  privileged      => false,
}
```

Ports, env, dns and volumes can be set with either a single string or as above with an array of values.

To use an image tag just append the tag name to the image name separated by a semicolon:

```puppet
docker::run { 'helloworld':
  image   => 'ubuntu:precise',
  command => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
}
```
