## Support

This module is currently tested on:

* Debian 8.0
* Debian 7.8
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Ubuntu 14.04
* Centos 7.0
* Centos 6.6

It may work on other distros and additional operating systems will be
supported in the future. It's definitely been used with the following
too:

* Archlinux
* Amazon Linux
* Fedora

## Examples

* [Launch vNext app in Docker using Puppet](https://github.com/garethr/puppet-docker-vnext-example)
  This example contains a fairly simple example using Vagrant to launch a
  Linux virtual machine, then Puppet to install Docker, build an image and
  run a container. For added spice the container runs a ASP.NET vNext
  application.
* [Multihost containers connected with
  Consul](https://github.com/garethr/puppet-docker-example)
  Launch multiple hosts running simple application containers and
  connect them together using Nginx updated by Consul and Puppet.
* [Configure Docker Swarm using
  Puppet](https://github.com/garethr/puppet-docker-swarm-example)
  Build a cluster of hosts running Docker Swarm configured by Puppet.

## Usage

The module includes a single class:

```puppet
include 'docker'
```

By default this sets up the docker hosted repository if necessary for your OS
and installs the docker package and on Ubuntu, any required Kernel extensions.

If you don't want this module to mess about with your Kernel then you can disable
this feature like so. It is only enabled (and supported) by default on Ubuntu:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  manage_kernel => false,
}
```

If you want to configure your package sources independently, inform this module
to not auto-include upstream sources (This is already disabled on Archlinux
as there is no further upstream):

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  use_upstream_package_source => false,
}
```

Docker recently [launched new official
repositories](http://blog.docker.com/2015/07/new-apt-and-yum-repos/#comment-247448)
which are now the default for the module from version 5. If you want to
stick with the old respoitories you can do so with the following:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  package_name => 'lxc-docker',
  package_source_location => 'https://get.docker.com/ubuntu',
  package_key_source => 'https://get.docker.com/gpg',
  package_key => '36A1D7869245C8950F966E92D8576A8BA88D21E',
  package_release => 'docker',
}
```

Docker also provide a [commercially
supported](https://docs.docker.com/docker-trusted-registry/install/install-csengine/)
version of the Docker Engine, called Docker CS, available from a separate repository.
This can be installed with the module using the following:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  docker_cs => true,
}
```

The module also now uses the upstream repositories by default for RHEL
based distros, including Fedora. If you want to stick with the distro packages
you should use the following:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  use_upstream_package_source => false,
  package_name => 'docker',
}
```

By default the docker daemon will bind to a unix socket at
/var/run/docker.sock. This can be changed, as well as binding to a tcp
socket if required.

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  tcp_bind        => ['tcp://127.0.0.1:4243','tcp://10.0.0.1:4243'],
  socket_bind     => 'unix:///var/run/docker.sock',
  ip_forward      => true,
  iptables        => true,
  ip_masq         => true,
  bridge          => br0,
  fixed_cidr      => '10.20.1.0/24',
  default_gateway => '10.20.0.1',
}
```

Unless specified this installs the latest version of docker from the docker
repository on first run. However if you want to specify a specific version you
can do so, unless you are using Archlinux which only supports the latest release.
Note that this relies on a package with that version existing in the reposiroty.

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  version => '0.5.5',
}
```

And if you want to install a specific rpm package of docker you can do so:

```puppet
class { 'docker' :
  manage_package              => true,
  use_upstream_package_source => false,
  package_name                => 'docker-engine'
  package_source              => 'https://get.docker.com/rpm/1.7.0/centos-6/RPMS/x86_64/docker-engine-1.7.0-1.el6.x86_64.rpm',
  prerequired_packages        => [ 'glibc.i686', 'glibc.x86_64', 'sqlite.i686', 'sqlite.x86_64', 'device-mapper', 'device-mapper-libs', 'device-mapper-event-libs', 'device-mapper-event' ]
}
```

And if you want to track the latest version you can do so:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  version => 'latest',
}
```

In some cases dns resolution won't work well in the container unless you give a dns server to the docker daemon like this:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  dns => '8.8.8.8',
}
```

To add users to the Docker group you can pass an array like this:

```puppet
class { 'docker':
  docker_users => ['user1', 'user2'],
}
```

The class contains lots of other options, please see the inline code
documentation for the full options.

### Images

The next step is probably to install a docker image; for this we have a defined type which can be used like so:

```puppet
docker::image { 'base': }
```

This is equivalent to running `docker pull base`. This is downloading a large binary so on first run can take a while. For that reason this define turns off the default 5 minute timeout for exec. Takes an optional parameter for installing image tags that is the equivalent to running `docker pull -t="precise" ubuntu`:

```puppet
docker::image { 'ubuntu':
  image_tag => 'precise'
}
```

Note: images will only install if an image of that name does not already exist.

A images can also be added/build from a dockerfile with the `docker_file` property, this equivalent to running `docker build -t ubuntu - < /tmp/Dockerfile`

```puppet
docker::image { 'ubuntu':
  docker_file => '/tmp/Dockerfile'
}
```

Images can also be added/build from a directory containing a dockerfile with the `docker_dir` property, this is equivalent to running `docker build -t ubuntu /tmp/ubuntu_image`

```puppet
docker::image { 'ubuntu':
  docker_dir => '/tmp/ubuntu_image'
}
```

You can trigger a rebuild of the image by subscribing to external events like Dockerfile changes:

```puppet
docker::image { 'ubuntu':
  docker_file => '/tmp/Dockerfile'
  subscribe => File['/tmp/Dockerfile'],
}

file { '/tmp/Dockerfile':
  ensure => file,
  source => 'puppet:///modules/someModule/Dockerfile',
}
```

You can also remove images you no longer need with:

```puppet
docker::image { 'base':
  ensure => 'absent'
}

docker::image { 'ubuntu':
  ensure    => 'absent',
  image_tag => 'precise'
}
```

If using hiera, there's a `docker::images` class you can configure, for example:

```yaml
docker::images:
  ubuntu:
    image_tag: 'precise'
```


### Containers

Now you have an image you can launch containers:

```puppet
docker::run { 'helloworld':
  image   => 'base',
  command => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
}
```

This is equivalent to running the following:

    docker run -d base /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"

This will launch a Docker container managed by the local init system.

Run also takes a number of optional parameters:

```puppet
docker::run { 'helloworld':
  image           => 'base',
  command         => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
  ports           => ['4444', '4555'],
  expose          => ['4666', '4777'],
  links           => ['mysql:db'],
  volumes         => ['/var/lib/couchdb', '/var/log'],
  volumes_from    => '6446ea52fbc9',
  memory_limit    => '10m', # (format: '<number><unit>', where unit = b, k, m or g)
  cpuset          => ['0', '3'],
  username        => 'example',
  hostname        => 'example.com',
  env             => ['FOO=BAR', 'FOO2=BAR2'],
  env_file        => ['/etc/foo', '/etc/bar'],
  dns             => ['8.8.8.8', '8.8.4.4'],
  restart_service => true,
  privileged      => false,
  pull_on_start   => false,
  before_stop     => 'echo "So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish"',
  after           => [ 'container_b', 'mysql' ],
  depends         => [ 'container_a', 'postgres' ],
}
```

Ports, expose, env, env_file, dns and volumes can be set with either a single string or as above with an array of values.

Specifying `pull_on_start` will pull the image before each time it is started.

Specifying `before_stop` will execute a command before stopping the container.

The `after` option allows expressing containers that must be started before. This affects the generation of the init.d/systemd script.

The `depends` option allows expressing container dependencies. The depended container will be started before this container(s), and this container will be stopped before the depended container(s). This affects the generation of the init.d/systemd script. You can use `depend_services` to specify dependency for generic services (non-docker) that should be started before this container.

The service file created for systemd based systems enables automatic restarting of the service on failure by default.

To use an image tag just append the tag name to the image name separated by a semicolon:

```puppet
docker::run { 'helloworld':
  image   => 'ubuntu:precise',
  command => '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"',
}
```

By default the generated init scripts will remove the container (but not
any associated volumes) when the service is stoped or started. This
behaviour can be modified using the following, with defaults shown:

```puppet
docker::run { 'helloworld':
  remove_container_on_start => true,
  remove_volume_on_start    => false,
  remove_container_on_stop  => true,
  remove_volume_on_stop     => false,
}
```

If using hiera, there's a `docker::run_instance` class you can configure, for example:

```yaml
---
  classes:
    - docker::run_instance

  docker::run_instance::instance:
    helloworld:
      image: 'ubuntu:precise'
      command: '/bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"'
```

### Networks

As of Docker 1.9.x, Docker has official support for networks. The module
now exposes a type, `docker_network`, used to manage those. This works
like:

```puppet
docker_network { 'my-net':
  ensure   => present,
  driver   => 'overlay',
  subnet   => '192.168.1.0/24',
  gateway  => '192.168.1.1',
  ip_range => '192.168.1.4/32',
}
```

Only the name is required, along with an ensure value. If you don't pass
a driver Docker network will use the default bridge. Note that some
networks require the Docker daemon to be configured to use them, for
instance for the overlay network you'll need a cluster store configured.
You can do that on the `docker` class like so:

```puppet
extra_parameters => '--cluster-store=<backend>://172.17.8.101:<port> --cluster-advertise=<interface>:2376'
```

### Compose

Docker Compose allows for describing a set of containers in a simple
YAML format, and then running a command to build and run those
containers. The `docker_compose` type included in the module allows for
using Puppet to run Compose. This means you can have Puppet remediate
any issues and make sure reality matches the model in your Compose
file.

Here's an example. Given the following Compose file:

```yaml
compose_test:
  image: ubuntu:14.04
  command: /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"
```

That could be added to the machine you're running Puppet using a `file`
resource or any other means.

Then define a `docker_compose` resource pointing at the Compose file
like so:

```puppet
docker_compose { '/tmp/docker-compose.yml':
  ensure  => present,
}
```

Now when Puppet runs it will automatically run Compose is required,
for example because the relevant Compose services aren't running.

You can also pass addition options (for example to enable experimental
features) as well as provide scaling rules. The following example
requests 2 containers be running for example. Puppet will now run
Compose if the number of containers for a given service don't match the
provided scale values.

```puppet
docker_compose { '/tmp/docker-compose.yml':
  ensure  => present,
  scale   => {
    'compose_test' => 2,
  },
  options => '--x-networking'
}
```

### Private registries
By default images will be pushed and pulled from [index.docker.io](http://index.docker.io) unless you've specified a server. If you have your own private registry without authentication, you can fully qualify your image name. If your private registry requires authentication you may configure a registry:

```puppet
docker::registry { 'example.docker.io:5000':
  username => 'user',
  password => 'secret',
  email    => 'user@example.com',
}
```

You can logout of a registry if it is no longer required.

```puppet
docker::registry { 'example.docker.io:5000':
  ensure => 'absent',
}
```

If using hiera, there's a docker::registry_auth class you can configure, for example:

```yaml
docker::registry_auth::registries:
  'example.docker.io:5000':
    username: 'user1'
    password: 'secret'
    email: 'user1@example.io'
```

### Exec

Docker also supports running arbitrary commands within the context of a
running container. And now so does the Puppet module.

```puppet
docker::exec { 'cron_allow_root':
  detach       => true,
  container    => 'mycontainer',
  command      => '/bin/echo root >> /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow',
  tty          => true,
  unless       => 'grep root /usr/lib/cron/cron.allow 2>/dev/null',
}
```
